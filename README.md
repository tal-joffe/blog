# My React personal page

## A simple personal page create mainly for improving my front-end development skills

This is a react-redux app built from Facebook's create-react-app boilerplate.
This project is hosted on GitHub pages and so contains only FE code.
the Posts for the blog are hosted on Google Drive

libraries I used:
1. react-thunk - for api calls in redux actions
2. Marked for markedown rendering to html (for posts)
3. react-bootstrap - for bootstrap components in react
